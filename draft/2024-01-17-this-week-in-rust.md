## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell), a *f*riendly *i*nteractive *sh*ell that used to be written in C++, but was recently rewritten in Rust (though admittedly they'll have to do some work until it hits your distro's repos).

Despite a lamentable lack of suggestions, llogiq is reasonably satisfied with his choice.

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

This week had some small regressions that did not warrant further investigation,
several of which were dismissed as being noise/blips in the data. There were
also a number of gains. (Don't get exicited about that 20.6% improvement, its an
measurement artifact from a temporary blip in the PR that immediately preceded
this week's triage.)

Triage done by **@pnkfelix**.
Revision range: [76101eec..f9c2421a](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=76101eecbe9aa80753664bbe637ad06d1925f315&end=f9c2421a2a6e34f3756900dd7d600704c08bfccb&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

3 Regressions, 5 Improvements, 5 Mixed; 3 of them in rollups
55 artifact comparisons made in total

[Full report here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/703f3ddf6f2777a4ab91e2a6f4e369b8f690cdfc/triage/2024-01-16.md)

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* [RFC: Precise Pre-release cargo update](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3493)
* [Add RFC combining Infra and Release teams](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3533)

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

* [disposition: merge] [Avoid non-local definitions in functions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3373)

#### [Tracking Issues & PRs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* [disposition: merge] [Stabilize single-field offset_of](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/118799)
* [disposition: merge] [Undeprecate lint `unstable_features` and make use of it in the compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/118639)
* [disposition: close] [Fix `non_camel_case_types` for screaming single-words](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/116389)

### [Language Reference](https://github.com/rust-lang/reference/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* *No Language Reference RFCs entered Final Comment Period this week.*

### [Unsafe Code Guidelines](https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Afinal-comment-period+sort%3Aupdated-desc)
* *No Unsafe Code Guideline RFCs entered Final Comment Period this week.*

### [New and Updated RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pulls)
* [RFC: Out-of-tree test suite](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3557)

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

# Quote of the Week

> Congrats to the #Rustlang and #Rust-for-#Linux community: the #LinuxKernel now contains the first useful thing built using Rust!

– [Thorsten Leemhuis on FOSStodon](https://fosstodon.org/@kernellogger/111741507899977461)

As with the crate of the week, this week saw a total lack of suggestions, so llogiq would like to offer you this piece of good news from the Linux side of things.

[Please submit quotes and vote for next week!](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/twir-quote-of-the-week/328)
